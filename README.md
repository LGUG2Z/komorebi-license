# Komorebi License

Official text of the [Komorebi license](./LICENSE.md).

## Provenance

The Komorebi license is primarily derived from the
[PolyForm-Strict](https://github.com/polyformproject/polyform-licenses/blob/1.0.0/PolyForm-Strict-1.0.0.md)
license.

It has been modified to integrate a "Changes License" based on the "Changes and
New Works License" of the
[PolyForm-Noncommercial](https://github.com/polyformproject/polyform-licenses/blob/1.0.0/PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0.md)
license, while also removing any use by noncommercial organizations from the
enumerated list of Permitted Purposes.

This results in a license which permits use and changes for Personal Uses (the
sole remaining Permitted Purpose), while restricting redistribution and denying
both commercial use and use by noncommercial organizations.

## Target Audience

1) Those who reject [genocide-friendly software
licensing](https://opensource.org/faq#evil)

2) Those who do not recognize corporate personhood and want to deny all
exploitative commercial and noncommercial use by corporations

3) Those who want their code to be freely available to individuals for personal
use, modification, learning and reference

4) Those who want to restrict redistribution
